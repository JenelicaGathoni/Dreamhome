              What do you say about waking up to the chirping of birds...?
            </figcaption>
            <p>
              I've always been the quiet type of person. So it's no wonder that
              tranquility is the first consideration to anything I am going to
              ever consider as a home. If something is going to wake me up: I
              give the birds that role;Not the roaring of some overworked
              engine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want nature noices to be the hugest part of my life. The
              bubbling of a stream , The sound of the wind as it makes it way
              through the leaves and the occassional pattering of raindrops on
              my roof. I want to build my home in a place where I can let my
              thoughts roam freely in the wind, a place where you can let go and
              live as freely as a bird.

              <p>
                A cosy nature themed living room with large natural lighting has
                always been my dream. The living room would be an important part
                of my life as this is where I get to let go after a long work
                day

              <h3>My Kitchen</h3>
              <p>
                The kitchen I beleive is the heart of every home.The kitchen is
                a place of joy and family. Neutral colors would be my first
                priority. This would ensure that cleaning doesn't take away the
                thrill to have a little fun in the Kitchen.
